A nicer looking discord theme based off of css snippets from the vencord official discord server. 
A separate file exists that changes the font to Arial Pixel (can be loaded alongside most if not all themes)

Color change addon when i can decide what color/ gradient color I should use (maybe).
May make the blur + pop-out settings a standalone theme (identical to how the font css works)


Will NOT be maintained much after publish. If anything breaks, feel free to fix it yourself or use a different theme.

INSTALL:
Make sure you have vencord installed first (duh). Download the .css, paste into the Vencord theme folder and toggle it on.

(I don't like doing the @import raw that other themes do mainly because it limits user customization)
